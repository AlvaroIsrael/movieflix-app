## üíª How to Run

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com)
and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/AlvaroIsrael/movieflix-app.git

# Go into the main app folder
$ cd movieflix-app

# Go into backend folder
$ cd movieflix-backend

# Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# Install the mongo database needed to run this program. See 'How To' below.

# Run the app
$ yarn start
```

This application will require mongo database in order to work properly:

- [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Frist you will need to install mongo database on your local machine and, after that, configure the databases using
both ```.env``` and ```ormconfig.json``` files which can be located in the ```src``` folder. The installation of that
database can be done in a variety of ways, but I personally believe the simplest one is to use docker. So I will
provide a brief guide on how to install then using docker and bitnami images.

Frist, download and install docker in your local machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Once docker is up and running, you can them install each database service using the following comands:

- [MongoDb](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mongodb)

```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb -e MONGODB_DATABASE=myLegendaryDatabase -p 99999:55555 bitnami/mongodb:latest

# The flag '--name' represents the name of your container, so in this case '--name mongodb' will name the container 'mongodb'.
# myLegendaryDatabase - Can be any string without quotes representing the name of your database.
# The flah '-p' maps the container port 99999 to your local machine port number 55555.
# You can choose whenever value you want, but keep in mind the ports must be available and default mongodb port is 27017.

# After that you can simply run the container by typing:
docker start mongodb
```

Once that is done you will need to configure mongo database in the application by changing the following files:

- ```ormconfig.json.example``` which should be renamed to ```ormconfig.json```

After that the following fields must be changed according to the database you just installed and set up.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "mongo",
    "type": "mongodb",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 55555,
    "database": "anthorflix",
    "useUnifiedTopology": true,
    "entities": [
      "./src/modules/**/infra/typeorm/schemas/*.ts"
    ]
  }
]
```

- ```.env.example``` which should be renamed to ```.env```
